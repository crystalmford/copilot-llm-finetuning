# Copilot LLM Fine-Tuning (Demonstration Project)

This repository contains a demonstration notebook created to showcase my abilities for the **Applied Scientist II – Copilot Tuning (Job #1856259, Microsoft M365 Copilot Team)** application.  
It illustrates end-to-end workflows for **LLM fine-tuning, evaluation, and alignment**, focusing on techniques relevant to Copilot scenarios.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Demonstrate post-training methods (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, RLHF, RAG) for adapting large language models to enterprise contexts.  
- **Scope**: Build, fine-tune, and evaluate models with emphasis on accuracy, efficiency, and alignment.  
- **Output**: Trained/adapted models with reproducible evaluation metrics, visualizations, and deployment notes.

## Contents

- `copilot_tuning_demo.ipynb` – Main demonstration notebook  
- `data/` – Placeholder for dataset references  
- `configs/` – Example YAML configurations for training and evaluation  
- `results/` – Evaluation results and plots

## Methods Demonstrated

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** integration  
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** with task-specific data  
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** for alignment  
- **Evaluation Harness** covering:  
  - Task performance metrics  
  - Guardrail/constraint compliance  
  - Latency & cost considerations
