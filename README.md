## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Demonstrate post-training methods (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, RLHF, RAG) for adapting large language models to enterprise contexts.
- **Scope**: Build, fine-tune, and evaluate models with emphasis on accuracy, efficiency, and alignment.
- **Output**: Trained/adapted models with reproducible evaluation metrics, visualizations, and deployment notes.

## Methods Demonstrated

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** integration
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** with task-specific data
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** for alignment
- **Evaluation Harness** covering:
  - Task performance metrics
  - Guardrail/constraint compliance
  - Latency & cost considerations
